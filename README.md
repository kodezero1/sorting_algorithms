## Introduction

In computer science, sorting is the process of arranging data in a particular order. Sorting algorithms are a fundamental topic and are used extensively in various applications, from data analysis to algorithm design. This repository provides C implementations of several popular sorting algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms

Here are the sorting algorithms currently included in this repository:

### [0. Bubble sort](./0-bubble_sort.c)
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm


### [1. Insertion sort](./1-insertion_sort_list.c)
* Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm


### [2. Selection sort](./2-selection_sort.c)
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm


### [3. Quick sort](./3-quick_sort.c)
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm


### [4. Shell sort - Knuth Sequence](./100-shell_sort.c)
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Shell sort algorithm, using the Knuth sequence


### [5. Cocktail shaker sort](./101-cocktail_sort_list.c)
* Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Cocktail shaker sort algorithm


### [6. Counting sort](./102-counting_sort.c)
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Counting sort algorithm

* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm


### [9. Radix sort](./105-radix_sort.c)
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Radix sort algorithm


### [10. Bitonic sort](./106-bitonic_sort.c)
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bitonic sort algorithm


### [11. Quick Sort - Hoare Partition scheme](./107-quick_sort_hoare.c)
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm


### [12. Dealer](./1000-sort_deck.c)
* Write a function that sorts a deck of cards.

## How to Use

To use these sorting algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kodezero1/sorting-algorithms-c.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:

   ```bash
   cd sorting-algorithms-c
   ```

3. Compile the C program of the sorting algorithm you want to use. For example, to compile the Bubble Sort algorithm:

   ```bash
   gcc sorting/bubble_sort.c -o bubble_sort
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./bubble_sort
   ```

5. Follow the program's prompts or modify the input data in the source code to suit your needs.
